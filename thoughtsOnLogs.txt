Protocol buffers probably aren't the correct solution.

Maybe use them in post-etl as a by-line thing.  Probably plain text is
better though.

The ETL processor should use Bruce's new hierarchy API.  Take
snapshots of the tree-structure of synapse.  The etlp will run in a
separate process on the already swept logs.  It should also do
by-date/time collation of multiple log files.  (that's easy, it's like
a merge sort style operation (read all the log files with the same
hour stamp, process line by line, always processing the oldest date
out of all the files.  Memory is O(n) where n is the number of
instance logs.

For log sweeping look at the Elastic Beanstalk log sweeping
capabilities.  Leveraging this would be ideal, but not necessarily
feasible.  Otherwise, the log sweeper would need to rename logfiles by
instance id or something similar.

Moving to logback isn't necessary and it's too high risk.
