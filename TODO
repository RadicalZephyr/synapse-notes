Factor the Map into an object

implement this interface
					ToolTip tip = DisplayUtils.tooltip(constraint.getValue());
					tip.placement("right");
					tip.applyTo(a);


-------the JSNI implementation is good for now.  Check this rev in to
       the dev branch, and then start working on wrapping alerts in a
       GWT widget (probably do button and collapse that way too!)

Think about how to do metric gathering and logfile parsing.  Look at
map-reduce algorithm etc. etc.

SearchPresenter needs to be refactored to have one internal and
external function that kicks off a new search, that way there's 
a consistency of how it's accessed.  Right now, setSearchTerm() seems
to be that entry point, except that setPlace calls that, and is used
internally.

Actually, it seems like setPlace is just done wrong, doing so much
other logic etc.  Really, setPlace should just set the place and be
able to be reentrant.
