*Log File Analysis
** Goal is a dashboard type interface
** Located on the Amazon Cloud
Do you have solutions that will integrate well with this (EC2, S3)?

** General Query Interface

*** Natural Language processing only?
The NLP looks quite powerful, but super specific.  

**** Tell me more about the custom W|A interface
A more structured format?

**** Can we program in special knowledge?
Is there a way to program in special knowledge about our dataset?
(like "shark image")

*** Queries that "filter" the data?
Specifically, we want to be able to compute things like the list of
new users, the list of users who signed up and never did anything, the
list of users who were once active but aren't any longer.

*** Save out query results/sub-queries
What has been your's/your customer's experience with formulating
complex queries?

*** Compute the complement of a query

** Data loading facilities
*** Storage
Can W|A use S3?

*** What facilities are there for annotating the data?
We don't want string search over our log file data, we want it to be
curated, and structured.
