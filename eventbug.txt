On talking about fixing the bug that bruce exposed.  We need to rip
out all of the event handling code that follows that pattern and
simplify it down to eventbus usage.  Then in every presenter, we can
follow the pattern of - injecting the eventbus, then providing a
wrapper method in the presenter class that allows you to fire an
entity-updated event


EntityUpdatedHandler needs to be removed!!
