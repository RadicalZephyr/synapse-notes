So the question I'm trying to answer:

How many presigned url's were handed out during each month (september,
october, november)?

Each line I get in the mapper is a log line.  So I need to identify
what the month is, then emit a key like "URL-OCT" with a number as the
value. I also need to identify the service call.

For the reducer, I want to simply aggregate.

Larsson's entity should be a separate map-reduce job

-emit any line that contains entity 'syn1446321' and emit that as
key, with the whole line as value.
No reducer.


we have stack/instance/{date}.gz
-lots of small (1-4kb) files

start with a file of stack names, this is the value for the first
step.
Using nlinesInput=1, the mapper will take that value, and produce a
set of keys that corresponds to (date, s3-file-path)

Then, we can reduce this by fetching each file from s3 (via value-path),
and then making sure it's sorted, then merging it with the output
file, which is s3://log-name-{date}.gz
