keep working on testCronExpression.  Cron expression is throwing a parse error...

Part of the problem seems to be, that the way that I added to the
spring configuration is causing pretty much the entire stack to be
reloaded and other parts overridden far more rapidly than it should
be.  



Our Spring Configuration is done wrong. It's causing severe test
run-time increases as we load and reload the application context.

First candidate for refactoring:
there is a class
org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer
that could totally replace our StackProperties project.  It would
allow us to specify the properties in the stack.properties file with
${prop.name}.  This would obviate the need for importing the
stackConfiguration spb.xml file for everything that needed it.
