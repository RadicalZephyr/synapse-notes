Questions for Sumo Logic

Love to see a demo.

What's the recommended solution for setting up collectors for
elastic Beanstalks?
-prefer not to use AMI's, but...
-External log collecting works? Or no?

We currently have logs that need a bit of pre-processing before they
really have all the information they need.  What's the recommendation here?
-one idea, similar pipeline to what we have now, but the pre-process
step happens in the collation.

Experience with syslog?  Effectiveness? A barrier to performance?

Exporting capabilities.  We're interested in capturing long-term
statistical trends as well.


Real-time: about 15 seconds lag

Collector's grab remote logs
-script adding a source.  We can roll the Collector jar into our war
files.


Ok, the plan is to try and start integrating the collector's into our
War files.  Declare it as a dependency, (probably provided scope) and
package it up, with some wrapper.conf files to configure it.


Plan: Package the tar.gz file as a maven project.  Email/link the file
to John Hill along with the pom for the project (or at least the
group-id and version number).

Then, specify it as a dependency of repo, do an install, do an
integration test run make sure that the tar file comes down.


Then, write a tomcat ServletContextListener


OK.  For the moment, we put it more or less on the back-burner.  The
necissity of using the AMI is a damper for us.  So start looking at
what it would take to do some other method.

One option not looked at yet.  Writing a log appender that pushes data
into DynamoDB so we have a database.  No more fooling with file size
or collation (to some extent).  But ease of looking at the data is a
bit compromised.


Also, for dealing with the log files, change the configuration so it's
not so dumb anymore (no gzipping at least), and then manually un-gzip
all the files already in s3
