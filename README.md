Synapse Web Portal
==================

The Web client frontend for the [Synapse Platform][1].

Issues
------

If you're looking for a place to report issues, we don't reliably
track the github issues.  We have our issues hosted on [Jira][2].


Contributing
------------

1. Fork it.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my_fix`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Fixed a bug"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my_fix`)
5. Create a pull request from your my_fix branch to our develop branch

We highly recommend the usage of the excellent [Git Flow][3] git
extensions.

Versioning
----------

We use [Semantic Versioning][4].
