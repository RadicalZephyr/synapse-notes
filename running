In order to build and run the web client:

in synapsewebclient/ run
mvn clean compile -Dmaven.test.skip=true

Assuming that the database for the local backend is all populated and
stuff (which also needs to be documented, but isn't yet).

then in trunk/integration-test/ run

mvn cargo:run

MAGIC!!!
...  Clearly there is a step missing here...
And the step is run the project in dev-mode from eclipse!!  a la the wiki boostrap page

to populate said database

MYSQL
drop database devgeoff;
create database devgeoff;

in trunk/integration-test/ run
mvn -Dit.test=IT100BackupRestoration verify


I should rewrite the portion of the bootstrapping wiki page to mention
explicitly that you need maven 3.0.3, not 2
