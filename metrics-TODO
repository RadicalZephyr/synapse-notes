brain storm about different metrics
-Search metrics, what kinds of searches, most popular facets, avg
number of facets

-Project accesses
--differentiate between clients?
                maybe, but it seems like the web client is largely
                covered by Google Analytics.  A metrics project for
                the R or python client would be neat, but of a totally different
                scope.  And in practice, most of the same information
                -- about Synapse usage at least -- can be collected by
                the repo-services


the Metrics Dashboard - 

move user login data out of log files and into... talk to Jon/Bruce/Mike
convert to MVP structure
display inactive projects
display inactive users
show usage over time
-turn current profiling metrics on, and push to cloudwatch




notes:
profiling metrics are in services-repository->profiler.org.sagebio...

need to read about spring's AOP stuff in order to get it

Currently one controller is profiled, probably want all 7 plus more stuff.
