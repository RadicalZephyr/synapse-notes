Thoughts:

JSON compression is out for the moment.  Will deal with when it
becomes a problem.  Ideally, we should try and detect whether it's
occurring so that we don't get a really confusing bug report.

taking raw search terms is going away.  So someone has to create the
new JSON search term to send to the search page.  That seems like a
job for the Search class?  maybe, that should probably stay small.

Kind of have to flip the call flow of the SearchPresenter on it's
head, so execute search isn't on the call path of most stuff, only for
when a new search is goTo'd.  Rearchitecting the class is called for,
and thus redo'ing the tests.

Things that search currently does:
text searchs
json object searchs
^syn[0-9]*$ redirects to the synapse object



setPlace is the canonical method for all Presenter's that allow the
GAM to set the place.  This can't go away it just needs to get
simpler.  The question is how simple can it get?  Because this is the
actual entry point to the class.


Need to clean up unit tests...  setSearchTerm no longer needs to be
tested because it has no logic.  And setSearchTerm is no longer the
appropriate entry point to test the logic contained in setPlace
