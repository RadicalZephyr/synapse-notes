Instructions for getting access to the Marconi network from
Ubuntu/Linux Mint

It's much simpler than the process described for gentoo.

Download the Marconi.p12 certificate.

Run in a terminal in the directory where the Marconi.p12 file is:
openssl pkcs12 -out marconi.pem -in Marconi.p12

It will prompt you for a password "everwhat" (minus the quotations),
and a passphrase to apply to the new PEM key.  The passphrase may be
left blank.

Then attempt to connect with the standard wireless network
configuration utility.

A dialog box should pop up, with a whole bunch of options, the
defaults work fine for all of them, you just need to specify the
certificate (the marconi.pem file we generated), and your hutchnet
user-id and password.
