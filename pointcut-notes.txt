BasicEntityController
- Entity gives us all the information we could want about itself
(path, entityid, etc.)


Pojo's data fields are fair game for Aspect usage (once they're

First level pointcut:
Capture only method's that are within classes with the @Controller annotation
@Pointcut("@within(org.springframework.stereotype.Controller.class)")

capture only methods that have the annotation:
@Pointcut("@annotation")
