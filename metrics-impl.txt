Here's how the metrics system will work.

There's a Web UI, written in GWT/GXT3.
This exposes and does pretty things with the data, which is available
from two (possibly three) sources:
-RDS High-resolution data window
-Amazon Cloudwatch Aggregates
-Long-term RRD of cloudwatch aggregates*

The data comes from two sources:
-Synapse Repository Services (possibly via logs, but possibly through
other means)
-Synapse Crowd Server(s) (via the logs)

These logs are scanned on a daily basis (could be more often if
wanted).

The scanning process will involve calling from one to three Simple
Workflow(SWF) workers:
-scan log data and update the RDS window
-take data from the RDS window and update cloudwatch
-2 week old data from cloudwatch that is still wanted into the
 long-term RRD storage

* If this third component is necessary, then it is questionable
  whether involving cloudwatch at all is cost-effective or wanted.
